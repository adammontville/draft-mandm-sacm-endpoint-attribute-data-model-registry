              SACM Endpoint Attribute Data Model Registry
     draft-mandm-sacm-endpoint-attribute-data-model-registry-latest

Abstract

   This memo describes a an interface to registries used to store
   endpoint attribute data models.  These data models are used for the
   purpose of automated endpoint assessment.

1.  Introduction

   Security automation assessments (i.e. vulnerability assessment,
   configuration assessment, etc.) often require enumerations of
   endpoint attributes to be known before such assessments can take
   place.  As technologies evolve and emerge, enumerations may change
   and new enumerations come into existence.  As such changes to the set
   of enumerations happen frequently.  A problem yet to be solved in
   security automation is the ability for enterprises to quickly, even
   dynamically, acquire (or potentially define) enumerations of endpoint
   attributes and make those enumerations available to the security
   automation tools operating in their enterprise.

1.1.  Scope of Solution

   The scope of this solution is constrained to the repository
   interface, and specifically avoids details about the data models
   stored in the repository.  This is because data models may vary,
   depending on attribute collection needs.  Coarsely, network devices
   are likely to have models represented using YANG, whereas traditional
   devices may be represented using OVAL.

2.  Terms and Definitions

   TBD

3.  Repository Interface

   An implementation of a data model repository MUST support the
   following operations:

   o  List data models

   o  Get data model X

   o  Add data model

   o  Update data model

   o  Remove data model

   Authorizations MUST be considered in an implementation.  Listing and
   getting data models SHOULD be open, but MAY be constrained to
   authorized entities.  Adding, updating, and removing data models
   SHOULD be restricted to authorized entities only, but MAY be opened
   to the world.  In other words, this document does not take a strong
   stance on what should or should not be authorized for a given
   repository.

4.  Repository Data Model Metadata

   In order for a repository to be queryable, a certain structure of
   metadata about the data models needs to be described.

   o  Name

   o  Version

   o  Endpoint applicability

   o  Date created

   o  Date last modified

   o  Author (individual or organization)

   o  Others???

5.  IANA Considerations

   This draft may end up defining one or more IANA tables.
